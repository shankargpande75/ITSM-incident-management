# ITSM-incident-management
## ABC Tech
## Project Summary

ABC Tech is an organisation operating in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets, which are handled to best practice by ITIL framework with incident management, problem management, change management and configuration management processes. ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor. Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation.

## Problem Statement
They came up with 3 key areas, where Machine Learning can help ITSM processes in ABC Tech:

1) Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces.
2) Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
3) Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure/misconfiguration of ITSM assets.
